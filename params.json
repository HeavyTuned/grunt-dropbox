Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nnpm install grunt-dropbox --save-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-dropbox');\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The \"dropbox\" task\r\n\r\n### Files\r\nWhen specifying files, the destination must be specified (i.e. specifying the source file only is not supported). The destination is the path from the root of your dropbox directory to upload the local files to.\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\n#### options.version_name\r\nType: `String`\r\nRequired: `False`\r\n\r\nAn optional string value that is appended to the destination path to differentiate artifacts from different builds. If using Travis CI, it is recommended that this be set to `process.env.TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER`.\r\n\r\n#### options.access_token\r\nType: `String`\r\nRequired: `True`\r\n\r\nA string value that is used to authenticate with Dropbox. Note that as this task is meant to be unattended, it is assummed that an access token has already been obtained. See [this wiki page](https://github.com/kbremner/grunt-dropbox/wiki/Creating-a-Dropbox-Access-Token) for more details.\r\n\r\n### Usage Examples\r\n\r\nDefine a `dev` task that will upload the `dist` directory to `uploads/sample-project/` in the dropbox account associated with the provided token:\r\n```js\r\ngrunt.initConfig({\r\n  dropbox: {\r\n    options: {\r\n      access_token: '<token>'\r\n    },\r\n    dev: {\r\n      files: {\r\n        'uploads/sample-project': ['dist/**/*.*'],\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nDefine a `dev` task that will upload the files in the root of the `dist` directory to a folder under `uploads/sample-project/` named after the current travis build number (i.e. for build number 32, the files will be uploaded to `uploads/sample-project/32/`). The files are uploaded to the dropbox account associated with the access token provided via the dropbox\\_access\\_token environment variable:\r\n```js\r\ngrunt.initConfig({\r\n  dropbox: {\r\n    options: {\r\n      access_token: process.env.dropbox_access_token,\r\n      version_name: process.env.TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER\r\n    },\r\n    dev: {\r\n      files: {\r\n        'uploads/sample-project': ['dist/*.*'],\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nPlease feel free to raise issues and submit pull requests. I'll try and reply to issues as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n## Release History\r\n* 0.1.2\r\n  * Made version_name optional\r\n  * Removed default value for access_token\r\n  * Updated documentation\r\n* 0.1.1\r\n  * moved to using promises, other code cleanup\r\n* 0.1.0\r\n  * initial release\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
